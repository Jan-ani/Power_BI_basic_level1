# Steps Followed to Create the Power BI Dashboard
### Understood the Requirements

* We began by reviewing the data and understanding what the client or audience needed.
* In this case, the goal was to analyze employee participation in training based on job levels, managers, and teams.
### Gathered and Prepared the Data

* The raw data was imported into Power BI Desktop.
* We cleaned and shaped the data using the Power Query Editor by removing unnecessary columns, filling in missing values, and renaming fields.
* The data was structured properly to enable seamless analysis.

### Built the Visuals

* We created visuals such as cards, bar graphs, pie charts, and slicers to represent the required insights.
### For example:
* Cards displayed total participation numbers.
* Bar Graphs visualized participation by job levels and managers.
* Pie Charts represented participation distribution by teams.
* Slicers allowed filtering by job level, manager, or team.
### Used Bookmarks and Buttons

* Bookmarks were added to save specific views of the dashboard.
* Buttons were created to enable navigation between different pages or sections of the report.
Customized and Polished

### Colors, themes, and formatting were applied to make the visuals more attractive and easy to interpret.
* Titles, labels, and tooltips were added for better clarity.
### Tested and Shared

The dashboard was previewed to ensure everything worked as expected, such as slicers, navigation, and visuals.
Finally, the dashboard was published to the Power BI service to share it with the team.
